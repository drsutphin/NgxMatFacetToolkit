# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Preset filters (application defaults + user-defined presets) with save/load/manage flows.
- Horizontal chip row with optional filter count badge (complete).
- Bug fix: Dark mode styling needs refinement (currently looks off).
- Bug fix: Demo padding shifts when applying the final filter; diagnose and fix.
- Enhancement: Hide horizontal scrollbar until chip list exceeds container width.

## Future Enhancements
- Theme overrides for non-Angular Material implementations via config inputs (light/dark + color control) while retaining Material defaults.
