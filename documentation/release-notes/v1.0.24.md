# v1.0.24 Release Notes

## Highlights
- Theme override system with light/dark controls and Theme Lab demo.
- Expanded modal, menu, chip, and button theming overrides.

## Fixes
- Multi-select category edits now correctly remove unchecked options.
- Disabled modal action buttons now render as disabled.
- Theme overrides are opt-in so other demo pages keep default styling.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
