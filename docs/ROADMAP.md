# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Preset filters (application defaults + user-defined presets) with save/load/manage flows.
- Horizontal chip row with optional filter count badge (complete).

## Future Enhancements
- Theme overrides for non-Angular Material implementations via config inputs (light/dark + color control) while retaining Material defaults.
